### Webhooks

Events,Payloads,Ping Event

Webhooks allow you to build or set up integrations, such as GitHub Apps or OAuth Apps, which subscribe to certain events on GitHub.com. When one of those events is triggered, we'll send a HTTP POST payload to the webhook's configured URL. Webhooks can be used to update an external issue tracker, trigger CI builds, update a backup mirror, or even deploy to your production server. You're only limited by your imagination.

Webhooks can be installed on an organization or a specific repository. Once installed, the webhook will be triggered each time one or more subscribed events occurs.

You can create up to 20 webhooks for each event on each installation target (specific organization or specific repository).
