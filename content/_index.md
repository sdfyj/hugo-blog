The highest excellence is like that of water. 
The excellence of water appears in its benefiting all things, and in its occupying, without striving to the contrary, the low place which all men dislike. 
Hence its way is near to that of the Tao. 
The excellence of a residence is in the suitability of the place; 
that of the mind is in abysmal stillness; 
that of associations is in their being with the virtuous; 
that of words is in their trustworthiness; 
that of government is in its securing good order; 
that of the conduct of affairs is in its ability; 
and that of the initiation of any movement is in its timeliness. 
And when one with the highest excellence does not wrangle about his low position, no one finds fault with him.
── from Tao Te Ching


上善若水。水善利万物而不争，处众人之所恶，故几於道。居善地，心善渊，与善仁，言善信，正善治，事善能，动善时。夫唯不争，故无尤。──《道德经》

以道德经的第八章上善若水开篇，来营造一种心平、共享的学习氛围，更重要的是想时刻谨记善、仁、信，有宽广的胸怀，做到处事儿而不惊，做自己的host。话说回来，之前一直想建立自己的文件管理系统，但并没有系统的研究过，偶然看到统计之都网站改版，由markdown+hugo+github的方法构建，方法非常适合像我这样跟公式和代码打交道的人，所以就决心研究了下构建者谢学长的博客源代码，稍加改动后形成现在的样式，用作文件管理，也可方便分享。
